# WebsiteRedesign
Our team has been working on a redesign of the landing page for an early-stage startup in Germany. We believe that a new design will increase the number of people who click through and join the startup's site. We have been testing the changes for a few weeks and the notebook is devoted to measuring their impact. We will try to quantify the change in the number of signed-up visitors and determine whether it is random or not.
